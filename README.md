## There are a few assumptions within this development
i) The admin and user role has yet to be established, but can be developed through database table or laravel privilege pacakage
</br>ii) The interface is accessible for all type of user(s) as for now.
</br>iii) The loan amount of user is always full (100% after deduction from down payment)
